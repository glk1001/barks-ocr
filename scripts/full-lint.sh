# Run every lint/static check over the whole repo, in one go.
# All checks run even if an earlier one fails; a summary is printed at the end.
#
# Checks: ruff check, ruff format (--check, so it reports rather than rewrites),
#         ty (--error-on-warning, matching the pre-commit hook), pyrefly (0 errors,
#         no baseline - see pyrefly.toml), cspell.
# Non-gating: uv audit (dependency CVEs) warns but never fails the run.
#
# Unlike the sibling barks-comic-building this repo has no deptry, vulture or
# import-linter configuration, so those are absent here rather than silently skipped.
#
# Static checks only - this does not run any tests (this repo has no test suite).
