The CSV, which ships in `barks_fantagraphics/data`, is hand-maintained: GLK adds a row

an error or a censorship fix. Everything else - the Fantagraphics volume, the scan image
stem and the printed book page - is derived here, and the rows are sorted into book
order.

The tool is idempotent, so it can be re-run after rows are added, and it writes nothing
