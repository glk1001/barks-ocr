    <h1>CARL BARKS Interviewed By EDWARD SUMMER</h1>

    <p>How I came to be a cartoonist is as much a mystery to me as it would be to anybody else. I have no cartoonists in my ancestral tree whatsoever, no artists that I know of, no writers that I know of; I was just a sort of a mutant that came along and I was born up in eastern Oregon on a little homestead. My parents had no cultural background, no education much, and I got through the eighth grade in a little one-room schoolhouse, no art training whatever, but I did have a desire to be a cartoonist. And I would draw pictures with charcoal on the walls of any kind of a building I happened to be in, and I would scrawl all over my schoolbooks and we had slates in those days. Imagine that—slates, those squeaky things. And I would draw on those slates and any kind of paper I could find.</p>

    <p>By the time I was 16, I had become pretty well assured that I wanted to be an artist or cartoonist more than I wanted to be a farmer. But, I lacked the opportunities to meet with people with the same sort of ideas, and I had to go out and be a cowhand and a farmer, a muleskinner, lumberjack, anything that happened to come along that would furnish me with a living. I'd worked in a printing shop, been a cowboy and a whole bunch of other things, with practically no success whatever—I was a failure at all of those enterprises. In 1928 I was working at riveting, not as a riveter, but as a rivet beater on a riveting gang in railroad car shops, when I decided I could sell cartoons to the comic books. Not comic books, but comic magazines, like <b>Whiz-Bang</b> and those old joke magazines. And so I drew a few cartoons. Surprisingly, they sold, and I discovered that I had to write jokes to fit the cartoons so I could sell more cartoons, and that way I got to writing one-line gags and illustrating them and selling them and even sold a couple to <i>Judge</i>, which was the real good joke magazine in those days. And, I even think I had one published in <i>College Humor</i>. I can't recall for sure now. I was doing that, and then I got a chance to go on the staff of <i>Calgary Eye-Opener</i> back in Minneapolis. I went there and worked four years.</p>

    <p>But the wages were getting smaller by the hour, and I read in the paper that Walt Disney's was looking for cartoonists, and I
    had been making a living as a cartoonist, so I drew up a few samples and sent them out there. This was along about October of 1935. They must have got an assistant back on Uncle Scrooge Dram, who was the hiring guy there at Disney's, and he suggested that I come and see him. Twenty dollars a week, that's all I told my mom at the Eye-Opener, and I went out there on a field gamble that I could make it. I started working with the in-betweeners. I think that was in the cel department but I'm not sure.</p>

    <h3>Was there a particular animator that you worked with?</h3>
    <p>No. The in-betweeners who were in-between just just took what ever odd jobs that happened to be lying around, and some thing that wasn't extremely important to the movie. They would do in-between drawings, that's what I think it was. training to be an animator would have an assistant and maybe a couple of in-betweeners. That could be a panic unit. So that was where the in-betweeners would go, and I went back through the person in training. Well, before I had finished the period of training, I was put over in a hit team doing tie-in of the *G'*. I think I must have finished the period of training before I got fired, but I turned in so many gaps to the comic strip department and also to the story department, wherever they would ask for much more assistance from the hoi polloi around the place, to pick up a little extra money. That I got put in the story department on a per manent basis.</p>

    <h3>Was drawing comics a lot more personally satisfying than work ing as an animator?</h3>
    <p>Oh, Gosh, yes. I couldn't have been an animator. It would have been too monotonous for me. You really need to have a tremendous field for presenting ideas and all kinds of activity and background. There's a wide range in the artwork that goes into comic books. In animation, you just draw on a little to. The charac ter repeatedly over and over for days at a time. You get no background. Just a lighted glass under your old. Oh, that'd be terrible!</p>

    <h3>How did you get into doing comics?</h3>
    <p>The first comic book work was in <strong>Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold</strong> in 1942, when I was still working in the story department at the Disney. I did all the text, the titles, all the balloon lettering, the lengths and was an adaption of an animation story that had been shot. I did just the drawing only - the other pages were by Jack Hannah, Bob Karp did two. So from a story my own. ted and gagged up in its original storyboard form by Homer Brightman and Harry Reeves. The board was written at the studio, and my sinuses couldn't take the conditioning. So I took a chance and quit Disney, and soon started writing and drawing for Dell by Whitman Publishing Company, which is the branch of Western Printing and Litho that published the comics. I took a rough to them.</p>
    <p>I have no more hope on how Western decided to start using original ten page Donald Duck stories in Walt Disney's Comics. Obviously, they were running out of newspaper strip reprints and needed some original stuff to fill the book. I didn't know they planned for a strip of mine. I just thought, well, they must be ready-written to draw. So I did, the crow story sev eral weeks after I left the studio. Maybe the fact that I was available and had done some work for them. Previously I had have done to some other artist. I noticed some bad errors in the pits that were for the artist to correct as they drew the story. The result was that they invited me to see if I could do a whole original story myself. The story of the kids and their rabbit foot, that the result. I made an animation cartoon approach, a story plotting in my early comic books because that approach had become second nature after seven years in the studio story department.</p>
    <p>I ordinarily worked on only one story at a time. I never could comfortably skip them up or start a new one while one was still unfinished. The stories were a continuous chain-of-thought thing with me. They were not just a subject. I always tried to do all of the last panel. Besides, I had a little mental rest after finishing a story.</p>

    <h3>Could you talk a bit about how your comics version of Donald differed from the screen version?</h3>
    <p>When working in the story department on the duck, I had be come quite familiar with the character so that he would be an animated cartoon. When I got to "own" the story, I was pretty much on my own, but I would make characters as much. Instead of making just a quarrelsome little guy out of him, I made a sym pathetic character. He was sometimes a villain, and he was often a real hero who was at his best. He was also a human being and like the average human being, and I think that is one of the reasons he has had his appeal.</p>

    <h3>What about the nephews - how they related to Donald and how they treated him?</h3>
    <p>The nephews are also a holdover from the animation days and in the studio we used to have them just mischievous little guys that were always in trouble with Donald. Now, I have made them in the comic books, I found that was for a limited field, so I began making them sort of smart little guys once in a while, and very smarty little guys at other times, and always a pleasant surprise in each story so that nobody could pick up a comic book and say, 'Well, the nephews are going to behave that and no. They wouldn't know that they had read the story that what those little guys were going to be so to in a particular sequence. So I broadened them like I did Donald. started out with some mis chievous little guys and ended up with little scientists, you might say. That was a big to do with comics.'</p>

    <h3>What are the differences between your ducks and human beings?</h3>
    <p>I guess I was confused on that. I'm afraid that there were times when I kept thinking of Uncle duck as human beings and treating them as human beings, and I even reached a point in the story, the first issue of <strong>Uncle Scrooge</strong>, I called him 'Otis a Poor Old Man.' I didn't call him a poor old duck. So I had always felt they were human beings, just humans with ducks' bodies. All their problems were the same as humans had. I guess that I humanized them.</p>

    <h3>Does anyone know where Donald's nephews came from?</h3>
    <p>Well, I'm not sure of that either. That's as music as anybody can get with them. I was working in the story unit at Disney's when they were brought in. I don't feel quite at home, in short, if they ever show it now, I think it shows, in the beginning. Donald rigging this note that comes with the one saying Donald's will is going snow a trip sometimes and she will be a will take care of three, lovely little girls while she's gone. And I get more comic with characters.</p>

    <h3>How did you come up with the idea for Uncle Scrooge?</h3>
    <p>I used to get a Christmas story going, and somehow a person just automatically gets back to the old Dickens Scrooge story, like the classic, 'cause that of the things that go along with Christ mas. It's that old gentleman that comes along at Christ mas, is the repetition of the old Scrooge classic. So I got to thinking of an old rich uncle, and gradually his story just kept building. Donald would have to go into a situation where I could use the rich uncle. And the kids naturally wanted Christmas trees, and they wanted to have around the old Scrooge. So the characters came up. So all the elements were there, and I just started hooking them together automatically. Now, I can't say where these things come from. I just had to get the idea to solve the story so all the parts just coming into my head from someplace and I don't know that I had ever read any story of a story of the ducks getting permission from their rich uncle to go up on Bear mountain and use his cabin over night. Well, that of course, that is how the rich uncle got to come into his. so that, so I thought in this thought that he wanted to know whether Donald was a good thing about that old uncle. he didn't like the situation of testing Donald's courage. That's the way those stories build. I have a bunch of things that have to go into a story, and so I just keep rolling around in the big room and fit it. It's like sewing together pieces of a shirt.</p>
    <p>The characters in a story always started with the inspiration of a funny situation that the ducks could go into. Then I would start thinking of gags that would apply to that situation and, Or I would pick up a piece of paper and just start writing on it, write</p>

    <div class="image-placeholder">Image Placeholder: Minnehaha Water Slide, ducks in a boat, with "MINNEHAHA WATER SLIDE SQUEAK DAY TODAY" text.</div>

    <p>down all kinds of little gags that I would think of. Even at night I would wake up and grab a piece of paper and note something down that I would happen to think of during the night that would apply to that particular story. After I had quite a few gags put together that I felt that I had enough to really make a story in teresting, then I would put them together in a story sequence so that I could write a synopsis, with a beginning, middle and end. This would be, oh, two pages of paragraphs of an end. Then, with that pretty well polished, I would start breaking it down into panels. That is, write in longhand what the ducks were doing in each one, and what the amount of dialogue that each one would have to say, and go on from panel to panel until I had detailed the business of a whole page, and that I would start on the next page. And, in fact, that's when the gags really begin to pop into the story - when I'm breaking it down into panels. I would just begin thinking of all kinds of different new things. Because each panel would suggest something that might happen in the panel for a little later, or a page or two later. The stories I would have a running gag developed. Sometimes I would start with a story that I felt would come out 30 pages long, and I would find that I was actually going to be about 20.</p>
    <p>Now, one of the main things in the construction of a story is the planting of gags, and that are going to develop later in the story. For instance, in one story I had the nephews have an animal parade that would call all sorts of animals. And you got to have for some time later when in the story, I planted that whistle early in the story. The kids would be blowing the whistle, and they would come a bunch of little animals. It showed what the whistle was for, and the reader could anticipate that it was going to be used sometime later. I remember when I worked in the</p>

    <div class="image-placeholder">Image Placeholder: Various animals and a character saying "OH, DELIVER ME!".</div>

    <p>story department down at Disney's, they had an analysis one time of what it is that makes a story plausible. And one rule was that if you're going to have a character pick up a gun and shoot some thing, don't just drag it in and have it happen. Plant it ahead. Plant it twice. If you're going to have a character pick up a gun and shoot some thing later in the movie, of course. Not as far as that in Disney movies, that's just an example - plant that gun twice be fore it ever shoots it, somewhere earlier in the story. Same in drawing anything.</p>
    <p>After I had the story laid out page by page, I would go back to the beginning and plan all my drawing in each panel. And rough out with light blue pencil where the characters should go. Each panel had to be composed so that the characters were very important to what little group as I could get them, and so that whatever they were doing was very clear to the reader. Then I would letter in the final dialogue, just in blue pencil, and since I had the whole page all constructed that way in rough, then I would go back and ink these characters. I would ink each character's shirt, head, and usually and going down to all the different details of the body. And then I would hand the page over to the wife, who would do the lettering and ink in all the background details. She's good at those things. And she would put in the solid blacks, in the duck's jacket, and the overcoats and so on. And then the recent splashy little white flashes in the ducks' eyes, the highlights that showed what directions they were looking.</p>

    <h3>What were the stages in drawing the art?</h3>
    <p>I usually draw the head first, which establishes the size of the character and then I draw the action line. [He uses an example to illustrate.] In a pose like this, the head and the torso is stretched out. The action calls for them to be stretched out much longer than they naturally would be. Their hats have to react - they fly off their heads. They contain hats to fly back in the air. Or rather, every part of the ducks' clothing has to show some bit of the action. It has to flow with the action. And they exaggerate them so that they're going to land in a big lake full of water must show, too, in their expressions.</p>

    <h3>Did you skip the preliminary process and just go direct with out drawing the art?</h3>
    <p>Not very much. It's very much better to draw the circles because then you get the construction, the basic construction of the way - like the skeletons, in other words. In the next stage their expressions have to be refined, which is done mostly with patting, redesigning and erasing. When I'm drawing the head I think about what their basic emotion is, what they are doing there. These little guys are very happy, they think they have lost a pile of money out in this desert. I try to show that emotion in their faces and in their bones, their eagerness as they look out across the sand, and think they can this they. They look less tired. Even their fingers have to express a certain amount of emotion.</p>
    <p>In drawing the duck's faces, I used to act out the expressions on my own face, all unconsciously. If I had the ducks angry, I would straighten my to draw an angry face and the setting so much that I was grimacing, and if I had them scared, which they were so much of the time, or overjoyed. I would draw them with my eyes wide open and practically popping the ducks' expressions, except that I didn't have a beak. And the nose was that I would end up with a headache because when you look at these ducks they have big round eyes, and somehow I was trying to imitate that, and my physical eyelids just couldn't make it. And my gaze would get so tired from doing up and down like that all day long.</p>

    <div class="image-placeholder">Image Placeholder: Portrait of Carl Barks.</div>

    <p>grimacing, making frowns, my forehead would all be kinked up. I would really be tired when the day's work was done. Oh, it was work.</p>

    <h3>When you were doing the dialogue, how did you work the words out and the captions?</h3>
    <p>I tried to make it as brief as possible. If I could find a word that would express what four words say, I would use that one word. So I tried to do a short, very crisp dialogue in the stories as a result of that contracting them down. And so in order to get di alogue that has no possible vagueness, I was sometimes in doubt about the syllables, and I would do that if it got down to it, and that also helped to create an even flow, so that it was almost like a poem and the way the ducks would speak would be.</p>

    <h3>How about the color?</h3>
    <p>The color was done at Poughkeepsie, New York at the printing plant. I got to do a color planner and then a bunch of girls who did the overlays. If I had to put any particular color into, which I would specify an shade for the reds, like the 'duck's desert yellow.' Most likely, when the book came out, the desert would be bright red. That happened too often to me. funny, I wondered that kind of thing, that required a specific color. I felt there was no use getting into those troubles to start with.</p>

    <h3>What about the covers?</h3>
    <p>I never had any way of indicating what the color was going to be there. Either that was all done back east.</p>

    <h3>Do you have any stories that are your personal favorites?</h3>
    <p>I do have like a certain ones. that is, they come to mind very quickly. And I will go and read some of my old stories as I did you know that I did. And because I was able to build them as I wanted to them. I never got any interfering from the company. I have a bunch of an affection for certain stories. I rather liked them - but I wouldn't say that I'd be really</p>

    <h3>Which ones come to mind?</h3>
    <p>Well, the first one is the square egg story [<strong>"Lost in the Andes"</strong>] - as a technical story. Technically it was a good one. The way the gave were all laced together and there were the tiny little gag run through and repeated every once in a while, like the bubble run with the kids. And square objects, of course. Another one that I liked, personally because of its sentimental quality, was in <strong>"Old California."</strong> I think I got a kind of a musical tone to my dialogue in the writing, which I was almost getting through music to.</p>

    <h3>Is an uncommon story compared to the other ones, because you really played around in your details and made more of the realism of the background - so many of the details in the story are drawn from life - and that makes everything so much more realistic. In your realism it's one of your favorites. And do you have a bunch of rich gags, something close to slapstick, it's fairly rough to really?</h3>
    <p>Yes. I tried to always tie my stories in to the locale. It had to be grounded right on the earth of that particular scene. That is, if you're going to be in the Andes, I had to have the Andes, and the gags had to be affected by whatever the atmosphere would be around the Andes. The kind of the people and the kind of nature and the terrain. everything had an effect on the gags and dictated the type of gags that I would use. And so it was with Old California. Those were fiction stories. But in that locale, the year that it was supposed to have been taking place in, and the type of people who lived in Old California. All these things flowed into the making up of the gags and plotting of the story.</p>

    <h3>How did you research the stories?</h3>
    <p>I would research them by going to any source that might have information about the locale or the type of business the ducks were going to be engaged in. If it were about miners, I would research little technical stuff about mining, and how gold looks, where it is found, and then I would take the National Geographic and look through them all the different climates, the mountains, the mountains were constructed, the way the terrain looked, was the people dressed in that area. All those things had to do with the researching of a story. And, of course, I always keep a big bunch of clippings, drawers full of clipping that I clipped out of the papers, of articles, or different types of animals, machinery, war equip ment.</p>

    <h3>With your interest in the way things work... do you enjoy science?</h3>
    <p>Oh, I guess I do. I know I choose of magazines. I always think that real math, mechanics and scientific things, I don't have time to read much, but I do read Popular Science and whenever I buy a specialty magazine it's something about some phase of science, or automobiles, or mechanics, or power saws or something.</p>

    <h3>Do you read Scientific American?</h3>
    <p>I used to take it. And I'm sorry I dropped the subscription at the time we moved. I've taken it for years. And I couldn't throw them away. I always liked to go back and dig through them. But it was such a heavy magazine and I was beginning to get tens of the storage problem, so when we moved, I don't know just to abandon them all, and I just didn't subscribe to it again, because my National Geographic was about all I could find room to store. That's one of my favorite magazines, National Geographic.</p>

    <h3>What are some of the other stories that you're particularly fond of?</h3>
    <p>Well, I liked <strong>"Land of the Totem Poles,"</strong> and also the forest fire story in the 1954 Dis Vacation Annual. And the first issue of <strong>Uncle Scrooge,</strong> Of the Lost Pages of Comics and Fables. I think the March 1953 story about the cyclists distributing those humorous words with the kids. I also liked the story about Uncle Scrooge's search for the horseradish down under the sea in the sunken ship. That gave me a chance to show his character - Uncle Scrooge was in such a situation that he could resolve all of his troubles by just leaving a guy to drown out there on the ocean, but he perpetuated his troubles by rescuing the guy and saving his</p>

    <div class="image-placeholder">Image Placeholder: Uncle Scrooge with a rifle and corn.</div>

    <p>life. It gave me a chance too, to show that villains don't reform just because you do them a favor. They don't turn around and do you a favor in return. They remain villains right through to the end.</p>

    <h3>One of my favorite stories is the one about the micro-ducks from outer space [Uncle Scrooge #83], because it also showed Uncle Scrooge's integrity. That's a fun mushroom story where he weighs out each grain of corn and takes that much money.</h3>
    <p>I liked that story myself. I felt that I had touched on something that was a little different, not just about any other type story that's come around. Creatures from outer space are villain ous characters, usually and they have to have some reason for because I have felt that out in outer space there are good people as well as bad, and here on earth there are good people as well as bad. So in that story, I did what I preached. I gave those micro-ducks were implausable little fellows, but for all we know, in outer space there are little planets or bigger than peanuts completely populated with people like us. Anyway, they are good little guys, they come down here just trying to write a bargain to buy some corn and they happen to meet up with Uncle Scrooge, who in this story was scrupulously honest. Well, he usually is honest. I play on that in most of his stories, that he is honest. He's just doesn't the only few times on people who are dishon est. So I used him as being representative of the better type of people who have on earth, the people who believe in doing the square deal by their fellow man or their fellow creatures, where ever they come from. And I felt the honesty of old Uncle Scrooge spoke well for his own people.</p>
    <p>You know, other writers have done stories using the character and making him their chief villain. I had one story where Scrooge is very greedy and he's fighting with somebody over a dime on the sidewalk, which doesn't seem quite the right thing for him to do. He seems to be well adapted to make good money.</p>
    <p>Well, he would squabble with Donald for instance, over a dime, so I guess he would squabble with another person over a dime, too. But he wouldn't fight unfairly, he would...or would</p>

    <p>he don't know [<strong>laughs</strong>]. I've never had him in that situation and I [<strong>laughs</strong>]. I always in the situation dictate what Uncle Scrooge would have to do under the circumstances.</p>
    <p>Of course, that micro-duck story is something that I just grafted out of thin air - you know. You might say, it's not based on anything on earth as we know it now.</p>

    <h3>There's a certain fable like quality to many of your stories. Did you ever consciously try to draw in that kind of a fable?</h3>
    <p>I wouldn't know whether I was or not. I'm not familiar enough with the construction of fables to know that they would be a fable. The few fables that I have read, that is, condensation of the Aesop's fables, have been in children's books, where they were only two or three, paragraphs long. I'm certainly no expert on fables.</p>

    <h3>When you were a child, were there any storytellers that you partic ularly liked?</h3>
    <p>Oh, I remember Old Mother West Wind, and the little foxes and the rabbits that lived out in the meadow. These were a little section in the children's pages of a newspaper. Now, who wrote them? It wasn't Harrison Judy to get name offhand, they weren'tイラストレーター so much except just one little black and white drawing. But that was about the limit of the children's type of reading that I ever did. Then, as I grew older, I graduated to the western pulps, and so on. Now, I have never read Treasure Island, or any of the children's classics. I've only read one story by Mark Twain that I know.</p>

    <h3>Did you used to like to go to the movies?</h3>
    <p>Oh, huh, huh! I'm a little loath to go to the movies until I was way up into my twenties. I lived on a ranch way out in the sagebrush in Oregon. There weren't many places to go.</p>

    <h3>What about comic strips?</h3>
    <p>Winsor McCay was certainly one of the influences in my life, because I was. Who was one of the first comic strips I can re member. It used to be published in the San Francisco Examiner, which we got on our farm. Those characters had a great influence on me. I wasn't so much an admirer of the drawing as it was of the story construction. And my favorite of his characters was old Doctor Pill, because he seemed to be a good guy. He was a detec tive, and trying to do his best, he could smell the smoke-day with the cigar was just fouling things up and making trouble and leading the kids astray. So, you can see I was a kind of a preacher if he wasn't in those days.</p>

    <h3>Happy Hoogan: I never liked Happy Hoogan is a character. I liked those other characters that he was in contact with much better. Happy Hoogan seemed to me to be a person who didn't do anything good in the world. He just blundered around. Gonk, who I had the most sympathy for the straight guy, and he was the supplied clown who was the main character of the strip. Kind of like Happy Googan, but, the Spain Plug and some of the other characters I loved.</h3>

    <h3>How about the adventure strips, like Tarzan and Prince Valiant?</h3>
    <p>Oh, I liked them. I liked them for their illustrations more than for their script. I could follow <strong>Prince Valiant</strong> - it aroused quite a lot of sympathy in me, but as for <strong>Tarzan</strong>, I just liked it for the drawings and that's about all.</p>

    <h3>Do you still write occasional stories?</h3>
    <p>No. I quit a couple of years ago. I finally begged off on it. It became such a grind to try to write stories.</p>

    <h3>Do you get to go to fan conventions or anything?</h3>
    <p>Oh, just to do it at all. After 25 years I had used up practically every locale in the world, and practically every emotional reason</p>

    <p>According to Mike Barrier, who ran another one of these illustrations in Funnyworld #16, Winter 1974-75. Barks was “hired in 1949 or 1950 to draw several political cartoons by a former resident of Hemet, Ca., who was embroiled with the mayor of Palos Verdes in a dispute over the legality of landing helicopters in the city.”</p>

    <p>We assume that this is the work of the Danish artist mentioned by Barks, in an Italian edition.</p>
    <p>the ducks might have for staging a fight or having an adventure. I had seen so many fight situations that I ran out. I was begin ning to repeat myself, and I'm sure I was. So I felt it was time for me to get out while I was ahead.</p>

    <h3>That's a shame. I'll bet you've got a couple of good stories left.</h3>
    <p>Not long ago I came up with a pretty good idea, and I sent it to Disney and asked them to relay it to on the publisher over in Denmark.</p>

    <h3>The Disneyland is there is particularly good and true?</h3>
    <p>They had a guy over there, excitedly, who could just draw rings around any of the other duck men. He could just draw like my ducks and even better. All they needed was a gag - just give them written on a piece of paper, and they would get a guy to make a script out of it. Tell him to over this to fellow to draw. I had just sent just the first outline of this story, but evidently the publisher over there didn't like it.</p>

    <h3>What happened to all your original artwork?</h3>
    <p>The original artwork was destroyed at the publishing house. They simply couldn't store all the drawings that came in for all their 15 or 20 comic books and none of the editors, none of the artists, felt that the stuff was ever going to be worth anything anyway, so all those thousands of pages of drawings were taken out to the incinerator and burned.</p>

    <h3>How did you come to do the two Duck stories?</h3>
    <p>I guess I was asked to draw and write the Barney Bear and Benny Burro stories because of the extreme shortage of comic book writers in those wartime years. The publishing company gave me a script one time for a story with Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and Petunia Pig. Well, I didn't do too badly on Porky and Petunia, but as all of you know that I just had to draw in new form on him. The ones he couldn't change he drew on another piece of paper and cut it out and pasted it over his head. But it didn't do too. I didn't get a brain out of it, but I was happy that it came out that way because I had no intention of ever being that much of a cartoonist that I could do Bugs Bunny. It was over my head.</p>
    <p>This interview was recorded in April 1975, in conjunction with a film series by Edward Summer entitled The Men Who Made the Comics, a project supported by a grant from The National Endowment for the Arts, a Federal Agency in Washington, D.C. Other films in the series include those on Milton Caniff and Jack Kirby. Portions of which have been seen on a PBS' special. These. Summer is currently working as a full-time for filled Tefft. The recording engineer for this interview was Sam Grossman. The transcript was edited and prepared for publication by John Benson.</p>
